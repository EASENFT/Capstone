# Obesity, Income, and Poverty
## Introduction 
This Capstone will look at the population in the United States and compare rates of obesity and median income to see if states with higher levels of obesity have a negative or positive correlation on median income, and poverty. The data used in this presentation is population data, poverty rates, and obesity rates, and income data from the US Census Bureau.

## Motivation
I love all things having to do with physical health and financial wellness. While ‘health’ be it financial or physical can appear in many different ways, I wanted to look at how physical health using BMI as measure of  affects financial wellness such as median income and poverty rates or vice versa.

	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python (Jupyter Notebook)
* Microsoft Excel
* Tableau 
* Power Point

## Data Questions 
* Is there any correlation with states that have higher rates of obesity and average/median income? 
* Is the average rate of obesity higher in states with high levels of poverty or lower median income?
* What is the average cost of health insurance with an obese BMI?
* What is the national cost of obesity related medical issues?
* How will this analysis help us to understand health, income, and poverty changes post COVID19 pandemic?
